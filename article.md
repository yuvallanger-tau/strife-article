Introduction
------------

[the lingua franca of quorum sensing]
Quorum sensing is the ability of bacteria to sense their own concentration.
When in small numbers, quorum sensing receptors are not activated, but when
a critical threshold is achieved, these receptors cause production of
"public goods" that are only beneficial when produced in unison.
In gram positive bacteria, evolutionary close species
[what's evolutionary close? check avigdor's references] exhibit
high diversity of their quorum sensing machinery. A proprosed model
that explains how such diversity forms introduces an evolutionary ratchet
in which the order of divergence in QS signal or receptor matters.
The approach used by Eldar et el. to investigate the interactions between
strains was to create a set of differential equations, analyzing them
algebrically (???) and numerically. This approach is amenable [?] for
mathematical analysis but disregards spatial effects. (Avigdor Eldar et el., 2011)

Stochastic cellular automata simulations were used to investigate social
interactions in bacteria, in which a lattice of abstract cells
compete with their immediate neighbors according to the state of their
microenvironment, thus mimicking a kind of biofilm.
The model used had only one dialect of quorum sensing, examining the existance
or loss of signal, receptor or public goods. Leaving  (Czaran et el. 2009).
