Introduction
------------

[the lingua franca of quorum sensing]
Quorum sensing is the ability of bacteria to sense their own concentration.
When in small numbers, quorum sensing receptors are not activated, but when
a critical threshold is achieved, these receptors cause production of
"public goods" [what is public goods?] that are only beneficial when produced in unison.
"Multiple bacterial species show intraspecific
divergence of their QS systems, where signals from one strain can
activate their own receptor but fail to activate and sometimes inhibit
a receptor from a different strain (2–7)."
In gram positive bacteria, evolutionary close species
[what's evolutionary close? check avigdor's references] exhibit
high diversity of their quorum sensing machinery. "This divergence
seems to be under strong selection, as implied by the functional
divergence and is also corroborated by rapid sequence divergence
(8–9), the signatures of diversifying selection (10–11), and the
spread of divergent QS systems through horizontal gene transfer
(3, 12)." A proprosed model
that explains how such diversity forms introduces an evolutionary ratchet
in which the order of divergence in QS signal or receptor matters.
The approach used by Eldar et el. to investigate the interactions between
strains was to create a set of differential equations.
This approach is amenable [?] to mathematical analysis
but disregards spatial effects. (Avigdor Eldar et el., 2011)

Stochastic cellular automata simulations were used to investigate social
interactions in bacteria, in which a lattice of abstract cells
compete with their immediate neighbors according to the state of their
microenvironment, thus mimicking a kind of biofilm.
The model used had only one dialect of quorum sensing, examining the existance
or loss of signal, receptor or public goods. Leaving the effects of
multi-lingual quorum sensing systems. (Czaran et el. 2009).

Methods
-------

I've used a combination of Eldar's theoretical model of divergent dialects
and Czaran's stochastic cellular automaton. The simulation consists of a toroid board.
Each cell has two QS related loci, one loci for the receptor and another for the signal.
There are two possible receptor alleles and two possible signal alleles.
